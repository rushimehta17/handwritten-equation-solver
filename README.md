# handwritten-equation-solver
Solve basic linear equations using neural network.<br>

1.Download the dataset. It is a large file so may take some time but takes less time than downloading zip and extracting it. If you dont want to download dataset then directly download the train_final.csv file.\\
2.handwritten_equation_solver.ipynb file contains the code for whole project. If you are downloading train_final.csv then don't run the data extraction part.\\
3.Training the model may take some time if you don't have gpu support, then you can directly download the model_final.h5 and model_final.json files.\\
4.Make sure everything is in the same folder or change the path of files in code accordingly.\\
5.Provide test image and see the result with aroung 98.5% accouracy.
